                        This is a redesign of the cover for <em>The Band Camino</em>'s self-titled album.
                        It keeps the same content as the original, while applying the design principles of positive/negative space, repetition, and hierarchy-color-contrast.

                        However, if I did, I would use this poster to support my campaign for United States Congress.

                        The composition draws inspiration from Cold War propaganda, with a twist.
                        The postage stamp design pays homage to the USPS and the colors are the same as seen on the national flag.

                        The Kamphoefner Building is an academic building on NC State University campus.
                        One of its facades has an interesting shape, featuring two square-shaped windows near the top.
                        <br>
                        This mural design was specifically designed for the Kamphoefner wall.
                        It takes inspiration from Barbara Kruger's work, which is characterized by bold text, red highlight, and a black-and-white background.
                        The text and background of the final design reflect the spirit of NCSU campus life and academics.
